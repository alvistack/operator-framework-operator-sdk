Description: SDK for building Kubernetes applications
 The Operator SDK is a framework that uses the controller-runtime library
 to make writing operators easier by providing:
   - High level APIs and abstractions to write the operational logic more
     intuitively
   - Tools for scaffolding and code generation to bootstrap a new project
     fast
   - Extensions to cover common Operator use cases
